[22.07.02 Mindflayers info](../3%20-%20Insights/1%20-%20Insights/22.07.02%20Mindflayers%20info.md)

Guard says people come back after mindflayer takes them. Different weird.

Always come from outside city north west.. not a lot of people go there. Cavern, screaming. 

People come back mentally fucked up. No soldiers ever come back

Come at dawn, middle of night, or early early morning.

Main gate usually where they see the most of them, never in broad daily. 

Storys of them coming go back way before the beginning of the city. #mindflayers/squids

See tons of guards fighting people that look like people. Some are kneeling down, dressed like wearing rags, holding his head for a second. Crying screaming in pain.



His skin changes slowly, purple to his face all his hair falls off his head and he screams and screams... #mindflayers/squids

Stop, stands up and tentacles out of his head
