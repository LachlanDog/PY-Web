Videogames vs trpgs, players redo levels and obstacles over and over till they build the skill to pass it. You can also design levels specifically, creating an atmosphere, specific moments they must see and go through. Different from trpgs, different world building... Players don't have to follow the story, but the story has to follow them? #videogame Also building a skill, reflexes or whatever, vs ... trpgs, freedom of choice? Mechanic mastery vs creative problem solving? Fail states... Videogames you just restart. Trpgs... Things get complicated?
