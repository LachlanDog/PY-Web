# Personality

He's a tortle with a southern accent, an easy going attitude, who is also following the adventurers as an opportunity to pick up "shiny things" for his "soon to be wife" back home, her name is Taynienne.

# Job
==Sydney's character signed a contract with a bank to take out an "adventurer's loan" of 2500 gp with 15% monthly interest==

The bank is a small one located in "Little Ivywood" and is called "The Flip Brothers" (or Les Freres Flip).

ialo sort of "comes with" the loan, to check in on you sometimes and make sure you survive to pay it off. Sometimes "adventurers" just don't survive when they're looking for dragons and stuff right? Lol Although he was not born there, ialo has lived in Little Ivywood for a couple of years now.

He sometimes leaves to track down unpaid contracts or to lend others a hand who have also bought the “adventurer’s loan”.


# Religion
As a cleric, he worships a god called “Udatah”. In his religion there is a belief that “a transaction must always happen, though it does not have to be a fair one”, ialo will never accept something for free. Often as a tradition in his religion, he will give someone a copper piece, as a sign of this belief.

The rules of “Udatah”, are often complex and can even seem contradictory to non-believers. Worshippers are required to memorize the rules, which are kept at a large temple, and it is tradition for them to return to the temple every 10 years to read them again.
