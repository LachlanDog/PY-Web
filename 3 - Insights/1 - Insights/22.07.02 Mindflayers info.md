Guard says people come back after mindflayer takes them. Different weird.
Always come from outside city north west.. not a lot of people go there. Cavern, screaming. 
People come back mentally fucked up. No soldiers ever come back
Come at dawn, middle of night, or early early morning.
Main gate usually where they see the most of them, never in broad daily. 
Storys of them coming go back way before the beginning of the city. #mindflayers/squids
