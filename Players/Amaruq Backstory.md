"Long ago, there was a great evil that fell upon the small quiet village of **Woodspine**, in the Northern forest. The village was attacked in the night and most children were slaughtered, leaving great sadness and decimation behind. It was said that after 9 days and 9 nights, the villagers’ prayers were answered by **Aruman, the great Wolf god of Protection**. It is said that he came down to the village and took the form of one of the people, but who could transform his body into the wolf form and use the beast’s strength. After the great evil was vanquished, Aruman granted a handful of chosen warriors his power to transform at will and use their blood as magic to protect the village in his absence. These chosen few were henceforth known as the **Wolf Warriors**."

For generations, this legend was passed down in the village of Woodspine in stories around campfires and at special celebrations. The village was inhabited by various races, including humans, half-elves, halflings and dwarves. There weren’t many travelers that came through Woodspine, but most found it quaint and quite charming. The secret of the Warriors was kept from outsiders, who considered **lycanthropy** a curse to be eradicated and feared, not a gift to protect the innocent. The clan lived in small houses on the face of the mountain that nestled the village further down. It’s in this village that Amaruq comes to life.

Amaruq was born to **Nauja** [^1], daughter of **Sesi**[^2], and **Nilak**[^3], son of **Nukilik**[^4]. She was always a bright child, keen on helping others. **She was taught honesty and generosity as fundamental values** to help her in the future. Her younger brother of four years, **Iluq**[^5], loves her very much, and looks up to her, and she makes sure to be a good role-model for him.

Amaruq was an incredibly gifted hunter, and made her very first knife out of obsidian at the age of 4. She trained from a very early age to become part of the new generation of Wolf Warriors. When she was 12, she proved to the council of the elders, among which her grandfather **Nukilik** was seated, that she could be trained as a Warrior. She was sent into the deep woods to survive alone for a week, and she came back after killing a bear on her fifth day and wearing its hide as a trophy.

To prevent an overpopulation of werewolves in the area around Woodspine, Wolf Warriors are only created every second generation. Amaruq was selected at the age of 17, along with three others. At the creation ceremony however, one of her hunter brothers **could not handle the transformation and his mind splintered**, overwhelmed by the savage beast within, killing a ceremonial attendee before running off into the woods. **He was later executed to preserve the safety of the village**. The two other boys that were with her did not survive the change either, their body rejecting the curse and killing them through fever and infection. **Amaruq was the sole survivor of her ceremony.** ==Iluq was considered as a replacement, but was deemed to brash to be given the curse, and only to be done as a last resort.==

Over the next year, Amaruq trained with Nukilik, one of the most skilled Warriors on the council. She was able to control the beast and learn some blood magic. **Her final task before being able to safely protect her village was to embark on an expedition to the outside world and learn about other cultures to return in three years’ time.**

She left her village on the morning of her **19th birthday and travelled to the nearest town of Little Ivywood.** Since Woodspine doesn’t have a strict economic system and instead relies on barter and trade, Amaruq didn’t have any currency on her. She was instructed by a potion shopkeeper to go to the edge of town and meet with the **Flip brothers**, who loaned money to travelers who were down on their luck. She was given 2 500 gold pieces, with the understanding that she would need to pay it back later. In the next town over, she saw a gnome sitting on a blanket with three over-turned cups, daring people around to play his game. She volunteered, thinking it couldn’t do any harm, and paid the small fee of 5 gold pieces to guess in which cup a small ball would be hidden after being shuffled around. While she was focused on the game, a halfling working with the gnome stole the little pouch she kept her money in and disappeared into the streets. Now practically penniless, with a tiny backup pouch containing her remaining balance of 125 gold pieces, she made her way to the market, where another halfling stole an apple and put it in her satchel, before screaming that she was the thief. Before she could explain herself, she was arrested and thrown in prison, where she meets with **Misha**, **Philibert** and **Blasius**.
