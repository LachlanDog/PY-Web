- Keep your word?
	- Unless you specifically don't
- How money matter... god... hm...... will be a huge part of his personality and outlook no?
- Parody of Atlas shrugged?
	- Everything costs somthing?
		- charge copper and silver for healing?
		- Won't help people for free, batters fine?
		- Not greedy, just a necessary transaction always?
- **Can't give or receive something for nothing?**
	- Always balance out somehow?

Money always has to exchange hands to be fair? ..copper pieces for glass of water...

copper piece is a tradition... cultural... god worship sign...

# Ferengi Inspiration
Male Ferengi were introduced to the world on their [Naming Day], one of few Ferengi ceremonies that included a tradition of bestowing (free) gifts on someone. ([DS9]: "[Rivals]")

The [Ferengi Attainment Ceremony] was a time in Ferengi tradition that an individual became old enough to make his own decisions. A young Ferengi who was about to embark on his first significant business opportunity might auction off personal items that had strong sentimental value in order to raise capital for his venture. ([DS9]: "[Heart of Stone]", "[Little Green Men]")

A Ferengi entering another Ferengi's home was required to pay an admission fee of one slip of latinum per person.

The importance of business was felt even in Ferengi government, as powerful businessmen could easily become powerful political figures, representing their companies the way states or worlds are represented in most other cultures.

***
So if Ferengi are greed... Ialo would be... **transactions are sacred?**
sort of... my word is bond? Or my contract?
Unless they go through the necessary steps..
