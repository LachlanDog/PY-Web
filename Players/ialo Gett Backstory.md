Character
Name: ialo Gett  (english pronouciation: ee-ah-loo)
Race: Tortle
Class: Cleric - Order domain
God: Udatah

Sydney's character signed a contract with a bank to take out an "adventurer's loan" of 2500 gp with 15% monthly interest

The bank is a small one located in "Little Ivywood" and is called "The Flip Brothers" (or Les Freres Flip).

ialo sort of "comes with" the loan, to check in on you sometimes and make sure you survive to pay it off. Sometimes "adventurers" just don't survive when they're looking for dragons and stuff right? Lol Although he was not born there, ialo has lived in Little Ivywood for a couple of years now.

He sometimes leaves to track down unpaid contracts or to lend others a hand who have also bought the “adventurer’s loan”.

He's a tortle with a southern accent, an easy going attitude, who is also following the adventurers as an opportunity to pick up "shiny things" for his "soon to be wife" back home, her name is Taynienne.

As a cleric, he worships a god called “Udatah”. In his religion there is a belief that “a transaction must always happen, though it does not have to be a fair one”, ialo will never accept something for free. Often as a tradition in his religion, he will give someone a copper piece, as a sign of this belief.

The rules of “Udatah”, are often complex and can even seem contradictory to non-believers. Worshippers are required to memorize the rules, which are kept at a large temple, and it is tradition for them to return to the temple every 10 years to read them again.




Secret that other players don’t know
ialo’s “soon to be wife” is actually some sort of succubus that has him charmed to collect money and objects for her. 

At some point ialo will stop collecting the money to pay off the “adventurer’s loan” and will be giving it to this succubus.

Or if you have a more fun monster/creature/idea in mind let me know! I was just trying to justify why a cleric would go against his beliefs…
Little Ivywood
- Seaside town, with smaller farms and things more inland. 

- Birds periodically steal things if you don't hold on tight, makes the locals laugh at out of towners caught off guard.

- Some fishing, but no huge boats. Fair amount of Mussels, clams, fish style food.

- Lots of old tales like selkie myth. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selkie

- Fairly Superstitious people.

- Old feud going on, some people might try to get you to pick a side? No one remembers what started the feud, but talk about what the other side has done through the years as retaliation.

- Cold water, rocks, not like a summer beach.

- Town-sign got all broken by a storm sometime, no one bothered to make a new one or fix it. "Why, did you forget where you are?"

- Sometimes richer folk come stay at the bigger inn that paints it as a quaint town to visit.

- No ones in a rush.

-Town festival sometimes.

-There's a small group of drug users, secret everyone knows. Majority attitude towards them: As long as they're not hurting anyone they can do what they want on their off time.
