+ 150 silver #money 

Just outside of capital #town/capital

Arthur lays down 5gp for the tavern to bring us drinks and beds for the night

So that's one for me
Spent 4 silver on the beer
Got 3 back

See torches coming in town, noise outside

Chaos people running outside of houses, torches
Hissing sound

Lizardfolk coming

Block the tavern door

Lizard folk banging to get in

We block door

Micha stays outside

Execution of a young man who came to town, raised skeletons, trial for necromancy. Sacrifice pit? #trial #necromancy #mystery

***

Give guy a copper for the advice about Misha hangover #copper 

No lizardfolk by lately
Lizardfolk afraid of fire 
Maybe crossed the lake


Amaruc buys a raw pigeon, cooks it in the sacrifice pit.

It's disgusting and she feels sick

Seagull - Mouette #french/word 

End there
